The combination of robust and fragile watermarking in this proposed intelligent scheme provides a suitable mechanism to protect valuable and original color images.

This is the Matlab source code of my published paper in a top tier journal:

paper title: An intelligent and blind dual color image watermarking for authentication and copyright protection

The source code includes, MY proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO), watermarking embedding, watermarking extracting;besides, includes some test color images and color image attacks.
